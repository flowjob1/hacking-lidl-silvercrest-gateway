 * rtl8196e_uart_bridge_main.c - In-kernel UART<->TCP byte shoveler.
 *
 * Replaces the former userspace serialgateway daemon (removed in v3.0).
 * All configuration goes through module parameters exposed in
 *   /sys/module/rtl8196e_uart_bridge/parameters/
 * Writes to these files are applied live, so the baud rate or listen port
 * can be changed at runtime without rebooting or rebuilding the kernel:
 *
 *   tty                    — tty device path (default "/dev/ttyS1")              [rw, root]
 *   baud                   — UART baud rate (default 115200)                     [rw]
 *   port                   — TCP listen port (default 8888)                      [rw, root]
 *   bind_addr              — TCP bind address (default "0.0.0.0" = all)          [rw, root]
 *   flow_control           — hardware RTS/CTS (default 1; 0 for EFR32 flash)     [rw]
 *   enable                 — arm/disarm the bridge (default 0)                   [rw]
 *   armed                  — actual bridge state (read-only)                     [ro]
 *   stats                  — rx/tx/drop counters (read-only)                     [ro]
 *   status_led_brightness  — brightness fired on 'uart-bridge-client' LED
 *                            trigger when a TCP client is connected (default 255) [rw]
 *
 * Boot sequence: the module loads with enable=0 and does nothing.
 * The init script S50uart_bridge sets the baud rate and writes
 * enable=1 once /dev/ttyS1 exists.
 *
 * Rationale and architecture: see DESIGN.md in this directory.
