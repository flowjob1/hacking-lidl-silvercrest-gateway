# Changelog — Zigbee Radio / Silabs EFR32 (Lidl Silvercrest Gateway)

All notable changes to the EFR32 firmware and tooling are documented here.

---

## [3.1.1] - 2026-04-27

Companion entry to the [v3.1.1 RTL8196E
release](../3-Main-SoC-Realtek-RTL8196E/CHANGELOG.md#311---2026-04-27)
— the heavy lifting (kernel UART-bridge hardening,
`flash_efr32.sh` TCP-client safety check, `radio.conf`
simplification) lives there. EFR32 side has only documentation
cleanups in this cycle.

### Documentation

- `23-Bootloader-UART-Xmodem/firmware/README.md` — drop the dead
  link to the unshipped Stage-2-only
  `bootloader-uart-xmodem-2.4.2.s37` (`*.s37` is gitignored except
  the `-combined.s37` artefact, see commit `7d67772`); replaced with
  a "build it locally" pointer. Restored a green `mkdocs --strict`
  CI build.
- Per-firmware READMEs (`24-NCP`, `25-RCP`, `26-OT-RCP`, `27-Router`)
  + the top-level `README.md` updated for the new single-key
  `radio.conf` model: `FIRMWARE_BAUD` is now the canonical baud
  reference (chip-side = host-side, since both ends of the UART
  link must agree). Legacy `BRIDGE_BAUD` / `OTBR_BAUD` references
  removed from user-facing prose; `flash_efr32.sh` stops emitting
  them and strips them from existing configs on every flash.
- `26-OT-RCP/docker/README.md` — three-case switching recipe
  (ZoH / OTBR-host / OTBR-gateway) collapses to a one-line `sed`
  flipping `MODE=otbr` on/off; no more `BRIDGE_BAUD` ↔ `OTBR_BAUD`
  swap.

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-26

Build matrix and documentation pass. Each per-firmware `build_*.sh`
script now takes the UART baud as a positional argument and emits
baud-aware filenames so multiple bauds can coexist in `firmware/`. A
new top-level `make-all-bauds.sh` builds the full matrix in one run.
Pre-built artefacts ship for every supported baud point so users
without a Silabs toolchain can flash any combination directly. The
companion `flash_efr32.sh` (top-level, see
`../3-Main-SoC-Realtek-RTL8196E/CHANGELOG.md` for the full refactor
notes) resolves the right `.gbl` via a glob — no more EmberZNet SDK
lookup.

### Build matrix

- Per-firmware build scripts (`build_ncp.sh`, `build_rcp.sh`,
  `build_ot_rcp.sh`, `build_router.sh`) take an optional positional
  baud:
  ```
  ./build_ncp.sh                # default per-firmware baud
  ./build_ncp.sh 460800         # explicit override
  ```
- Output `.gbl` / `.s37` filenames embed the baud:
  ```
  ncp-uart-hw-7.5.1-<baud>.gbl
  rcp-uart-802154-<baud>.gbl
  ot-rcp-<baud>.gbl
  z3-router-7.5.1-<baud>.gbl
  ```
- New `make-all-bauds.sh` wrapper builds all variants in one run
  (NCP×5, RCP×3, OT-RCP×1, Router×1), idempotent (skips files that
  already exist), with `--force` and `--list` options.

### Pre-built firmware shipped

| Firmware | Baud points |
|---|---|
| NCP-UART-HW (7.5.1) | 115200 / 230400 / 460800 / 691200 / 892857 |
| RCP-UART-HW | 115200 / 230400 / 460800 *(cpcd POSIX baud ceiling)* |
| OT-RCP | 460800 *(matches OpenThread default)* |
| Z3 Router (7.5.1) | 115200 *(no UART data path)* |

End-to-end validated on hardware against Z2M (NCP & RCP), the ZoH
adapter (OT-RCP bridge mode), `otbr-agent` in Docker, and on-gateway
`otbr-agent`.

### `firmware/` directory cleanup

Two batches of dead weight removed from the per-firmware `firmware/`
directories:

* **Unshipped `.s37` artefacts** — every per-firmware build emits
  both `.gbl` (UART/OTA path) and `.s37` (J-Link/SWD path), but only
  the *combined-bootloader* `.s37` is end-to-end useful for users
  (the one-shot J-Link image to install Stage 1 + Stage 2 on a virgin
  chip). Dropped 15 orphan `.s37` files (~1.4 MiB) from `23-`, `24-`,
  `25-`, `26-`, `27-` and tightened `.gitignore` so future builds
  don't re-introduce them. Kept:
  `23-Bootloader-UART-Xmodem/firmware/bootloader-uart-xmodem-2.4.2-combined.s37`.

* **Pre-v3.0 manual-flash legacy in `24-NCP-UART-HW/firmware/`** —
  the directory still carried `flash_ezsp{7,8,13}.sh` plus a MIPS
  `sx` xmodem-send binary (~166 KiB) from the pre-v3.0 workflow
  (scp the script to the gateway, push the `.gbl` over `sx` on the
  serial line). Replaced end-to-end by the repo-root `flash_efr32.sh`
  driving `universal-silabs-flasher` over the in-kernel UART bridge —
  these scripts have been unreachable from the docs since v3.0.
  Removed.

### `POST-MORTEM-bootloader-recovery.md`

New top-of-tree post-mortem documenting why a hardware `nRST` pulse
on the EFR32 cannot enter the Gecko Bootloader on this gateway, and
what was tried:

- PIN reset always boots the application slot — Gecko Stage-2 only
  enters its UART menu on `SYSREQ`+magic or a `BTL_GPIO_ACTIVATION`
  pin pulled by the host, neither of which is wired on the Lidl PCB.
- `PB11` (the canonical `BTL_GPIO_ACTIVATION` pin in old Gecko
  bootloaders) was checked empirically — not routed to the RTL8196E.
- Tuya stock firmware confirms the limit: zero `/sys/class/gpio`
  references, recovery is software-only via
  `ezspLaunchStandaloneBootloader`.

Lists two untested alternative paths (A: chip-reset on every reboot;
B: `PA5`/CTS as `BTL_GPIO_ACTIVATION`) for future work — Alternative
A landed in v3.1 (see RTL8196E CHANGELOG); B is parked.

### Documentation

- Per-firmware READMEs (`24-NCP`, `25-RCP`, `26-OT-RCP`, `27-Router`)
  rewritten for v3.1: new `flash_efr32.sh` CLI, baud-aware
  filenames, gateway-side `radio.conf` keys (`MODE`, `BRIDGE_BAUD`,
  `OTBR_BAUD`) plus the new chip-identity keys (`FIRMWARE`,
  `FIRMWARE_VERSION`, `FIRMWARE_BAUD`) shown in every "Gateway state
  after flash" snippet.
- `2-Zigbee-Radio-Silabs-EFR32/README.md` adds a "Gateway-side
  runtime configuration" section, a per-firmware supported-baud
  table, and splits the `radio.conf` keys into "chip-identity" vs
  "daemon-routing" so readers see at a glance what's informational
  vs operational.
- `22-Backup-Flash-Restore/README.md` and
  `23-Bootloader-UART-Xmodem/README.md` refreshed (USF probe-methods
  patch reference; chained bootloader+app flash walkthrough).
- `26-OT-RCP/docker/README.md` lays out the three OT-RCP use cases
  side-by-side with their gateway-side configuration; emphasises
  that all three share `FIRMWARE=otrcp` (the chip is the same; only
  the daemon-routing keys differ).
- `25-RCP` and `26-OT-RCP` Z2M `configuration.yaml` examples now
  externalise the device list (`devices: devices.yaml`) like 24-NCP
  does — keeps personal IEEE addresses out of git.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-16

### UART baud rates — 230400 ceiling removed

The long-standing 230400 baud limit has been eliminated across all
firmwares. The root cause was an RTL8196E UART divisor N+1 quirk (see
`3-Main-SoC-Realtek-RTL8196E/32-Kernel/POST-MORTEM-6.18.md`), not
userspace latency as previously believed.

**Tested baud rates with zero framing/overrun errors:**

| Firmware | Default baud | Max tested | Transport |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| NCP-UART-HW | 115200 | 892857 | in-kernel UART↔TCP bridge |
| RCP-UART-HW | **460800** | 460800 | cpcd via in-kernel UART↔TCP bridge (cpcd has no 892857 support) |
| OT-RCP | **460800** | 460800 | otbr-agent (direct UART, on-gateway) |
| Router | 115200 | N/A | No UART data path |

### 26-OT-RCP
- **Default baud raised to 460800** — aligns with OpenThread's own
  default. Firmware, S70otbr init script, docker compose, and all
  documentation updated. OTBR users get 4× throughput with no
  configuration change.
- Pre-built firmware rebuilt at 460800.

### 24-NCP-UART-HW
- **Firmware rebuilt at 460800** for testing (committed earlier on
  `kernel-6.18` branch). Default distribution remains 115200; power
  users can rebuild at up to 892857 and set the in-kernel UART bridge
  baud to match via `/userdata/etc/radio.conf:BRIDGE_BAUD=`.
- Z2M `configuration.yaml` updated with `baudrate: 460800`.

### flash_efr32.sh
- **Flash any firmware from any baud/mode state.** The script now handles
  all transitions (NCP↔OT-RCP↔RCP) regardless of the current firmware
  baud rate (115200–892857).
- **Smart detection via radio.conf**: reads the persistent radio mode
  (`MODE=otbr` → Spinel@460800) and `BRIDGE_BAUD=` to pick the right
  probe speed, instead of relying on `ps | grep` (which missed crashed
  daemons on the old serialgateway-based path).
- **Targeted probing**: OT-RCP probes `spinel:460800` only (~15ms);
  NCP/RCP probes `ezsp`+`cpc` at detected baud. No more 30s full scan.
- **FailedToEnterBootloaderError recovery**: when USF detects the
  firmware and enters the Gecko Bootloader (baud changes to 115200),
  the script automatically switches the in-kernel bridge to 115200
  (flow control off) and flashes via `bootloader:115200`.
- **TCP port readiness**: `wait_for_port` polls TCP:8888 after every
  bridge reconfiguration, replacing fragile `sleep 1`. Prevents USF
  `AssertionError` crashes on unstable connections.
- **USF probe retry**: transient transport errors (TCP not fully ready)
  trigger one automatic retry instead of aborting.
- **radio.conf cleanup**: NCP/RCP/Router flash deletes radio.conf
  (`rm -f`) instead of leaving a 0-byte ghost file.
- **USF probe patch regenerated**: all bauds 115200–892857 for EZSP,
  Spinel, and CPC protocols.

### 25-RCP-UART-HW
- **RCP@460800 validated**: pre-built firmware rebuilt at 460800 baud.
  Tested with cpcd 4.5.3 + zigbeed 8.2.2 (EZSP v18) + Z2M. cpcd
  does not support non-standard bauds (892857), so 460800 is the RCP
  maximum.
- **Simplicity SDK 2025.6.2 → 2025.6.3**: zigbeed build updated to
  latest patch (Feb 2026). End-device move delay config, Green Power
  fixes. EmberZNet stays 8.2.2 (build 436→532), EZSP v18.
- **Removed MEMO-uart-bridge-kernel.md** — kept on `kernel-6.18` branch.

### 25-RCP-UART-HW — multipan POC explored, tested, dropped

A Zigbee + Thread multipan Docker stack (cpcd + zigbeed on IID=1 +
otbr-agent on IID=2) was drafted and added to the tree during v3.0
dev. End-to-end test on hardware: cpcd connects, zigbeed attaches on
IID=1 (EZSP v18), but **otbr-agent fails on IID=2** with
`GetIidListFromUrl: InvalidArgument`. Root cause is a hardware limit —
Silicon Labs' Concurrent Multiprotocol (CMP, concurrent Zigbee + Thread
on one radio) is a **Series 2-only** feature; our EFR32MG1B is
Series 1 and only supports Dynamic Multiprotocol (BLE + one of
Zigbee/Thread, never both 15.4 protocols together). GSDK 4.5.0 has no
multi-PAN RCP sample for MG1B.

Since the gateway's hardware will never change, the whole POC was
dropped: `docker-compose-multipan.yml`,
`cpcd-zigbeed-otbr/Dockerfile.multiarch`,
`z2m/configuration-multipan.yaml`, and the CI workflow that built
`:poc`. A short `cpcd-zigbeed-otbr/README.md` remains as a tombstone
pointing at the working single-protocol paths
(Zigbee via `docker-compose-zigbee.yml`, Matter-over-Thread via
`../../26-OT-RCP/docker/docker-compose-otbr-host.yml`).

### Firmware rebuild against v3.0 sources

All five firmwares rebuilt against the current sources (GSDK 4.5.0 +
ARM GCC 12.2). Stage 2 bootloader `.gbl`/`.s37`, NCP and Router
produce **bit-identical binaries** (deterministic build, sources
unchanged). RCP and OT-RCP pick up a +88 B delta coming from the
`.slcp` baudrate cleanup below. The Stage 2+Stage 1 combined `.s37`
sees a small metadata-only delta.

### 25-RCP, 26-OT-RCP — .slcp baudrate realigned with .h override

In `rcp-uart-802154.slcp` and `ot-rcp.slcp`, the `BAUDRATE` config
value was 115200 at the `.slcp` level but 460800 in the `.h` patches
that overlay the generated config. The `.h` wins at compile time, so
runtime was already 460800 — but the two layers disagreeing misled
anyone reading the `.slcp`. Normalised to 460800 on both; the Silabs
Configuration Wizard `<i> Default: 115200` hints are kept since they
legitimately document the upstream SDK default.

### 24-NCP-UART-HW — Z2M device list externalised

- `z2m/configuration.yaml` no longer carries a hard-coded `devices:`
  block; the list lives in a separate `devices.yaml`. Device-roster
  updates no longer churn the main config.
- Unused `baudrate:` dropped from the Z2M config (inherited from the
  serial adapter URL).

### Tooling

- `25-RCP-UART-HW/patches/measure_uart_overruns.sh` — dev helper that
  reads UART framing/overrun counters via sysfs during RCP stress tests.

### Documentation
- All firmware READMEs (24-NCP, 25-RCP, 26-OT-RCP, 27-Router) updated:
  replaced "460800+ not supported" with full baud rate table; removed
  all references to in-kernel UART bridge.
- EMBERZNET-8.x-GUIDE.md: removed "overruns" warning.

---

## [2.1.5] - 2026-04-04

### 26-OT-RCP (OTBR on gateway)
- **HA REST API: PascalCase kept**. `python-otbr-api` 2.9.0 (HA 2026.4)
  still sends PascalCase in PUT requests — upstream camelCase `otbr-agent`
  rejects them. PascalCase `otbr-agent` works with all HA versions.
  See [python-otbr-api#238](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-otbr-api/issues/238).

---

## [2.1.3] - 2026-04-01

### 26-OT-RCP (OTBR on gateway)
- **IPv6 mDNS fix (`accept_ra=2`)**: `S70otbr` enabled IPv6 forwarding
  which silently disabled Router Advertisement processing. The gateway
  never acquired a GUA via SLAAC, so mDNS only announced the IPv4
  address. Fixed: set `accept_ra=2` on eth0 after enabling forwarding. (#77)
- **Channel Manager enabled**: `otbr-agent` now built with
  `OT_CHANNEL_MANAGER` and `OT_CHANNEL_MONITOR` (+14 KB). Enables
  `ot-ctl channel manager` for graceful channel changes across the
  Thread mesh. Channel change also works from the HA Thread UI.
- **HA REST API compatibility**: `build_otbr.sh` patches ot-br-posix
  REST API JSON keys from camelCase back to PascalCase at build time.
  Fixes "Failed to call OTBR API" in Home Assistant's Thread integration
  (`python-otbr-api` < 2.9.0 expects PascalCase).

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-22

### flash_efr32.sh
- **Auto-reinstall USF on patch change**: `flash_efr32.sh` now stores the
  md5 hash of the applied `silabs-flasher-probe-methods.patch` in the venv.
  On next launch, if the patch has changed, the venv is removed and USF is
  reinstalled with the new patch automatically.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### 24-NCP-UART-HW
- **Docker Compose stack**: new `docker/` directory with Mosquitto + Zigbee2MQTT
  (ember adapter) + Home Assistant. Self-contained for NCP users.

### flash_efr32.sh
- **OTBR support**: stops otbr-agent, cpcd, zigbeed before starting serialgateway
  in flash mode — no longer requires manual daemon management.
- **Remove 460800 baud**: gateway UART unreliable at 460800 (see 25-RCP-UART-HW).
  Removed from baud rate recovery scan and USF probe patch. Saves ~30s on flash.

### silabs-flasher-probe-methods.patch
- Drop all 460800 entries (EZSP, SPINEL, CPC). Add EZSP@230400, SPINEL@115200,
  SPINEL@230400.

### 22-Backup-Flash-Restore
- MEMO-universal-silabs-flasher.md: document 460800 removal rationale.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-11

### 26-OT-RCP
- **3 use cases, 1 firmware:** ZoH (Zigbee on Host), OTBR on host (Docker),
  OTBR on gateway (native) — all use the same OT-RCP firmware
- 3 Docker Compose stacks: `docker-compose-zoh.yml`, `docker-compose-otbr-host.yml`,
  `docker-compose-otbr-gateway.yml`
- Radio mode switching support in Docker compose files
- Thread network formation guide (use case 3: OTBR on gateway)
- Tested devices: IKEA TIMMERFLOTTE, BILRESA, MYGGSPRAY (all Matter/Thread)
- README restructured around the 3 use cases with architecture diagrams

### 22-Backup-Flash-Restore
- Technical memo: [MEMO-universal-silabs-flasher.md](22-Backup-Flash-Restore/MEMO-universal-silabs-flasher.md)
  — how USF works over TCP, baud rate mismatch problem, recovery mechanism

### flash_efr32.sh
- **Auto-recovery from non-standard baud rates:** when firmware runs at 230400
  or 460800 (e.g., after a custom build), the script scans baud rates, lets USF
  detect and enter the Gecko Bootloader, restarts serialgateway at 115200, and
  flashes. Tested with Spinel (OT-RCP) and EZSP (NCP).
- Patches USF probe methods at install time (`silabs-flasher-probe-methods.patch`)
  to add SPINEL@115200, SPINEL@230400, EZSP@230400
- SSH `-n` flag prevents stdin conflicts when piping firmware selection
- Default gateway IP: 192.168.1.88 (replaces placeholder throughout docs)

### Documentation
- IP placeholders replaced with default 192.168.1.88 across all Docker and Z2M configs

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-05

- Tested: IKEA TIMMERFLOTTE (22.8 °C, 54.69 %, battery 100 %)
- Removed erroneous 460800 baud memo (actual root cause: PCB signal integrity)

### Build environment
- Unified build scripts: `build_rtl8196e.sh` (bootloader + kernel + rootfs + userdata), `build_efr32.sh` (all 5 firmware)
- Fixed Docker builds: GLIBC mismatch, lzma conflict, tool path detection
- All 9 build scripts work both in Docker and natively
- `nano` and `serialgateway` binaries now committed to skeleton for fresh clones
